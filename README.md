# 📦 E-Commerce Order Management System (Intern Edition)

---

## 👋 Welcome

This project is designed to be a hands-on learning experience, guiding you through the development of a foundational e-commerce order management system using Go. You'll gain practical experience with backend development concepts, Go's ecosystem, and building robust APIs.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to provide a structured learning path for interns to master key backend development concepts using Go. By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of:

* **Go Syntax & Gin Basics:** Fundamental Go programming and building web applications with the Gin framework.
* **Database Design & GORM:** Designing relational databases and interacting with them efficiently using GORM.
* **Authentication (JWT):** Implementing secure user authentication with JSON Web Tokens.
* **CRUD APIs:** Creating robust APIs for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
* **Middleware:** Understanding and implementing middleware for request processing.
* **Pagination & Filtering:** Handling large datasets by implementing pagination and filtering.
* **Error Handling:** Implementing effective strategies for handling errors gracefully.
* **Writing Modular, Maintainable Code:** Structuring your codebase for scalability and easy maintenance.
* **Building Business Logic with Validations:** Implementing complex business rules and data validations.

---

## ✨ Features

This system will include the following core modules:

### 👤 User Module

* `POST /register`: Register a new user account.
* `POST /login`: Authenticate a user and receive a JSON Web Token (JWT) for subsequent authenticated requests.
* `GET /profile`: View the authenticated user's profile (requires JWT).

### 📦 Product Module

* `POST /products`: (Admin only) Add new products to the catalog.
* `GET /products`: Retrieve a paginated list of available products.
* `GET /products/:id`: View detailed information for a specific product.

### 🛒 Cart Module

This module handles the user's shopping cart, with cart items persistently stored in the database.

* `POST /cart/add`: Add a product to the user's cart, specifying quantity.
* `GET /cart`: View the current contents of the user's cart.
* `DELETE /cart/:item_id`: Remove a specific item from the cart.

### 📄 Order Module

This module manages the order placement process and order history.

* `POST /order/place`: Place an order from the items in the user's cart, including validation for product stock.
* `GET /order/:id`: View the details of a specific order.
* `GET /orders`: Retrieve a paginated history of the authenticated user's orders.
* Admin APIs will also be available for viewing all orders in the system.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project follows a modular and layered architecture to promote maintainability and separation of concerns:

├── database/             # Database initialization and connection logic
│   └── db.go
├── models/               # Database models/schemas (Go structs mapping to tables)
│   ├── user.go

## 🛠️ Skills You'll Cover

Throughout this project, you'll develop a strong understanding of various technical concepts:

| Area           | Concepts                                                  |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Go** | Structs, interfaces, packages, methods, error handling    |
| **Gin** | Routing, middleware, JSON handling, request/response cycle |
| **GORM** | Auto migrations, associations (One-to-Many, Many-to-Many), advanced queries |
| **DB Design** | Designing relational schemas for Users, Products, CartItems, and Orders, understanding relationships |
| **Business Logic** | Implementing complex logic like validating stock during order placement, grouping cart items into orders |
| **Auth** | JWT token generation, parsing, and validation with middleware integration |
| **Pagination** | Implementing efficient data retrieval using `limit` and `offset` |
| **Modular Code** | Structuring applications with layered controllers, services, and models for better organization |

## ✅ Intern Growth Path (Weekly Tasks)

This project is structured into weekly tasks to guide your learning and progress:

| Phase  | Task                                                               |
| :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Day 1** | Set up the PostgreSQL database, define `User` and `Product` models using GORM, and implement simple CRUD operations for products. |
| **Day 2** | Develop `POST /register` and `POST /login` APIs. Implement password hashing for security and integrate JWT token generation and validation using middleware. |
| **Day 3** | Implement the Cart module. Design the `CartItem` model with associations to `User` and `Product`. Add logic to add products to the cart and manage quantities. |
| **Day 4** | Focus on the Order module. Implement the `POST /order/place` logic, including crucial validations for product stock and deducting stock upon order placement. |
| **Day 5** | Enhance product and order listing APIs by implementing pagination and filtering capabilities. Also, implement an order summary view. |
| **Day 6** | **Bonus Challenges:** Choose one or more of these advanced tasks: Dockerize the application for easier deployment, integrate Swagger for API documentation, or add search functionality to product listings. |

## 🧪 Tech Stack

* **Go:** The primary programming language for the backend.
* **Gin:** A high-performance HTTP web framework for Go.
* **GORM:** An excellent ORM library for Go, simplifying database interactions.
* **PostgreSQL:** The recommended relational database for this project (though SQLite can be used for local development for simplicity).
* **JWT:** JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication.
* **Swagger (Optional):** For generating interactive API documentation.
* **Docker (Optional):** For containerizing the application and its dependencies.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Go (version 1.18 or higher recommended)
    * PostgreSQL (or SQLite for local development)
    * Git

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd ecommerce
    ```

3.  **Set up your database:**
    * **PostgreSQL:** Create a new database and a user. Update the `config/config.go` file with your database credentials.
    * **SQLite (for local dev):** GORM can automatically create an SQLite file. No extensive setup is needed.

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

5.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```
    The application will typically run on `http://localhost:8080`.
